# KnightsofJavaScript_game

# Objective
The function of this game is to create a fully functional browser-based turn-based game, in which players will battle against each other, defeat each other, and
ultimately come out victorious.

# Instructions
You will be given a template project with the basic mechanics needed for Player 1 to function correctly. You will be expected to then
take the starter code and replicate the same logic for Player 2, ensuring there are no bugs or errors in your browser console when
the user plays the game. You will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this to work. This game should be fully functional, bug /
error-free, and an engaging experience for users.
